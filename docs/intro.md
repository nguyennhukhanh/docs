# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **ThanhHoaJS in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new ThanhHoaJS project** using the CLI.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed on your system

## Installation

Install ThanhHoaJS CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @thanhhoajs/cli
```

## Create a New Project

Generate a new ThanhHoaJS project using the CLI:

```bash
thanhhoa new my-project
```

This command will:
1. Create a new directory named `my-project`
2. Download the starter template
3. Set up the project structure
4. Install all necessary dependencies

## Start Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project
bun dev
```

Your site will be available at http://localhost:3000. You should see "Hello, ThanhHoa!" in your browser.

The development server features hot reload - any changes you make to your files will automatically update in the browser.
